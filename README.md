Hello, 

I'm Lucas.

I'm a developer with a little bit of knowledge in several of the major fields of information technology. Currently I'm practicing to become proficient in a very particular style of full-stack development. One that combines the practical front-end of react, the efficiency of webassembly/rust, the graphical beauty of threejs and the organization of webpack + docker.

 - Understand a lot about rust.
 
 - Understand some things about the cpu and techniques for processing optimization.

 - Very comfortable with python.
 
 - Getting used with developing with nodejs.
 
 - Some starter understanding of graphics and rendering.
 
 - Built webservers packaged with docker using rust.
 
 - Built webservers packaged with docker using nodejs + webassembly.
 
 - Very little understanding of GraphQl (but it's in my list of things to learn next).
 
 - Built a rest backend that connects to a remote mysql server.
 
 - Built a debian desktop application using gtk.
 
 - Built a small multi-threaded app that renders a mandelbrot fractal.
 
 - I have coded for pic microcontrollers before using c.
 
 

I don't have a very good perspective for design and creating good-looking apps. But I know how to make good-looking, readable and efficient code.
